# Blog app

> This exercise is to set up a rails back end application using rails API only application.

[Link to my React app](https://github.com/julie-ify/hello-react-front-end)

## The learning objective of this project are

- Use controllers to handle requests and render empty views.
- Install Ruby on Rails framework.
- Use Ruby gems as a software packages system.
- Understand Rails naming conventions.
- Create rails API.
- Use API end point to get data


## Built With

- Ruby
- Rails
- API
- Postgresql
- Rubocop

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

### Setup
- ```git clone https://github.com/julie-ify/hello-rails-back-end.git```

- ```cd hello-rails-back-end```

### Running The App

- Run ```bundle install``` to install all the necessary gems
- Run ```rake db:create:all``` and ```rake db:migrate``` then run ```rails s``` 
- Go to the browser and type `localhost:3000` to see the app
- Make sure to run my Rails back end application first before running the React app so that it takes up the `port 3000`. This is very important as my rails API end point must run on `port 3000` for the API to work.
- Once the back end is runing on `port 3000` then start the react app and you will be prompted to run the server on another port like `port 3001`. You will receive a message in your terminal like this `Would you like to run the app on another port instead? ¬ª (Y/n)`. Please enter `y` so that the react app will start on `port 3001`.
